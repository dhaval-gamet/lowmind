*"Democratizing Deep Learning for Resource-Constrained Environments"*

</div>

## üöÄ Overview

**LowMind** is an ultra-optimized deep learning framework specifically designed for low-end devices like Raspberry Pi, embedded systems, and resource-constrained environments. Built from scratch by a solo developer in India, this framework prioritizes memory efficiency and computational optimization over feature bloat.

### üéØ Key Philosophy

> **"Simplicity with Power"** - Enabling deep learning capabilities on devices where traditional frameworks fail due to memory and computational constraints.

## ‚ú® Features

### üß† Memory Optimization
- **Ultra-Low Memory Footprint**: Conservative memory management with 64MB default limit
- **Lazy Gradient Allocation**: Gradients allocated only when required
- **Intelligent Memory Manager**: LRU-based tensor cleanup and aggressive garbage collection
- **Chunked Operations**: Large matrix operations processed in memory-friendly chunks

### ‚ö° Performance Enhancements
- **Raspberry Pi Optimized**: Specialized for ARM architecture and limited resources
- **Efficient Tensor Operations**: Optimized forward and backward passes
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Pure NumPy implementation, no heavy dependencies
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Comprehensive system health monitoring

### üîß Technical Capabilities
- **Automatic Differentiation**: Custom backward pass implementation
- **Neural Network Layers**: Linear, Conv2d, Dropout, Activation functions
- **Loss Functions**: Cross-entropy, MSE with memory-efficient implementations
- **Optimizers**: SGD with momentum and weight decay support

## üõ† Installation

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Required packages
pip install numpy psutil

# For Raspberry Pi
sudo apt update
sudo apt install python3-pip python3-numpy python3-psutil
```

### Installation Steps
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/dhavalgamet/lowmind.git
cd lowmind 
```

## üìñ Quick Example

```python
import lowmind as lm
import numpy as np

# Create a simple neural network
class SimpleNN(lm.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = lm.Linear(784, 128)
        self.fc2 = lm.Linear(128, 10)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x).relu()
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Initialize model and data
model = SimpleNN()
x = lm.Tensor(np.random.randn(32, 784))
y = lm.Tensor(np.random.randint(0, 10, (32,)))

# Forward pass
output = model(x)
loss = lm.cross_entropy_loss(output, y)

# Backward pass
loss.backward()

print(f"Loss: {loss.item()}")
```

- ‚úÖ Compatible with all RPi models
- ‚úÖ Minimal CPU temperature impact
- ‚úÖ Real-time system monitoring

## üîç Advanced Usage

### Memory Monitoring
```python
from lowmind import memory_manager, RaspberryPiAdvancedMonitor

# Monitor system health
monitor = RaspberryPiAdvancedMonitor()
stats = monitor.get_system_stats()
print(f"CPU Temp: {stats['cpu_temp']}¬∞C")
print(f"Memory Usage: {stats['allocated_mb']:.1f}MB")

# Get detailed memory info
mem_info = memory_manager.get_memory_info()
```

### Custom Layer Development
```python
class CustomLayer(lm.Module):
    def __init__(self, input_size, output_size):
        super().__init__()
        self.weights = lm.Tensor(
            np.random.randn(output_size, input_size) * 0.01,
            requires_grad=True,
            name="custom_weights"
        )
    
    def forward(self, x):
        return x @ self.weights.T
```

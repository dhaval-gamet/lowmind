## üîß Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- NumPy
- psutil

### Quick Install
```bash
pip install numpy psutil
```

### Clone Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dhavalgameti/lowmind.git
cd lowmind
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Core Components

#### 1. Memory Manager
```python
class MemoryManager:
    """
    Advanced memory manager optimized for Raspberry Pi's limited resources
    Features: LRU cleanup, memory limits, real-time monitoring
    """
```

#### 2. Tensor Operations
```python
class Tensor:
    """
    Memory-optimized tensor class with automatic differentiation
    Supports: +, -, *, /, @, ReLU, Sigmoid, Tanh, Exp, Log
    """
```

#### 3. Neural Network Layers
- `Linear` - Fully connected layers
- `Conv2d` - 2D convolutional layers  
- `Dropout` - Regularization layer

#### 4. Loss Functions
- `cross_entropy_loss` - For classification
- `mse_loss` - For regression

## üí° Usage Example

```python
import lowmind as lm
import numpy as np

# Initialize memory manager
memory_manager = lm.MemoryManager(max_memory_mb=64)

# Create a simple neural network
class SimpleNN(lm.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.fc1 = lm.Linear(784, 128)
        self.fc2 = lm.Linear(128, 10)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.fc1(x).relu()
        x = self.fc2(x)
        return x

# Initialize model and optimizer
model = SimpleNN()
optimizer = lm.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Training loop (conceptual)
for epoch in range(epochs):
    # Forward pass
    output = model(input_data)
    loss = lm.cross_entropy_loss(output, target)
    
    # Backward pass
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()
```

## üéõÔ∏è System Monitoring

LowMind includes comprehensive system monitoring for Raspberry Pi:

```python
monitor = lm.RaspberryPiAdvancedMonitor()
stats = monitor.get_system_stats()

print(f"CPU Temperature: {stats['cpu_temp']}¬∞C")
print(f"Memory Usage: {stats['memory_percent']}%")
print(f"Health Score: {monitor.get_health_score()}/100")
```
